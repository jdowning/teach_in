Or how about this guy? I mean, I wear glasses and use a computer, but I don't think I look like this.

---

## invention

---

## game

---

## app

---

## Or maybe you've thought...

---

## Wouldn't it be great if there was something that could do all my homework?

---

## Do all my chores?

---

## Writing software is all about solving problems!

Note:
There are problems all around you that you could solve with software
You just have to look!

---

## Software developers take ideas like these and turn them into solutions!

## Computers:
## are they SMART or DUMB ?

Note:
Take a poll: who thinks computers are smart or dumb. Ask WHY.

---

![dumbcomputer](http://www.qualityontime.eu/short/no-brain.jpg)

Note:
Computers are dumb.
They are machines.
They have no brain.
Guess who has the brain?

---

## Software developers have to tell the computer what to do

Note:
YOU have the brain. You can use your brain to tell the computer to do ANYTHING YOU WANT.

And even if you think you don't want to be a software developer, remember that fact when you work with computers. YOU are in control, YOU supply the instructions, YOU are in control.

# Experiment!

![pbj](https://afterhoursdenver.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/pbj.png)

Note:
It's time for an experiment. For this experiment, I'm going to be be the computer. I will need a volunteer to be the software developer to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Write directions on board for all to see.
"Now I'm going to execute these instructions just like a computer. Remember...I'm dumb."
Make PBJ...poorly.
1. Open the bag of bread
from the middle
2. Put one piece of bread to the side
throw across the room
3. Put peanut butter on one piece of bread
giant glob on both
4. Put jelly on the other piece of bread
5. Smash them together
the wrong way

## Every day, I get to sit down to my laptop and use a computer to solve problems

Note:
Funny part about this statement -- I actually STAND at my laptop!

---

## And, I get to work at home!

![hammock](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fe4vjuNnXz9oWj-9LciIie1r3bi-LGwYDucYu9mPDW0PsMuWeU4gdhF2vRjmG7E7UubLJ1SqOXVJxvMyJbuOsrGmsiE-yaROBy1yq9WfXTI0zuqGYTrvxCBnUK8-D8Ac4AV62nbInLY=w576-h384-no)

Note:
That's really me sitting in a hammock with my laptop at WORK!

---

## How did I get here?

Note:
This is a great question. You know why? Because I don't have a perfect answer.

---

## Things I like

Problem Solving

Technology

Creativity

Note:
I have always enjoyed (a) problem solving (b) technology (c) and being creative.
Over time, I practiced getting better at each of these three things to develop my career.
That means I'm not JUST good at one or the other, but I have to get good at different things.

---

## What does that mean for you?

Note:
Are you creative? Do you like technology?
Or creatively solving problems with technology?
Then YOU can be a software developer.

And the best part?

---

## You can start today!

Note:
Here's a little secret: unlike many other careers, you don't need to wait until you're an adult to get started with software development. Do you know how to use a computer? Do you have ideas you want to explore?

---

# Get started!
